- 👋 Hi, I’mthe founder of Theoretical Intelligence Institute (TII), a research initiative focused on advancing the theoretical foundations of artificial intelligence and cognitive systems.
- 👀 I’m interested in developing mathematical models and theoretical frameworks that enhance our understanding of intelligence, both natural and artificial. My work involves exploring topics like logic, computation theory, and cognitive architectures.
- 🌱 I’m currently exploring advanced topics in machine learning, formal logic, and knowledge representation, aiming to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical applications in AI research.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on research projects related to AI theory, cognitive modeling, and formal reasoning systems. If you're passionate about pushing the boundaries of theoretical intelligence, feel free to reach out!
- 📫 You can reach me via the contact form on the official Theoretical Intelligence Institute website, or directly through my GitHub profile.
- 😄 My preferred pronouns are he/him.
- ⚡ A fun fact about my work: My research often blends philosophical concepts like epistemology and metaphysics with advanced computational theories to better understand how machines can replicate human-like intelligence.
